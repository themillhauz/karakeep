# Karakeep MCP Server

This is the Karakeep MCP server, which is a server that can be used to interact
with Karakeep from other tools.

## Supported Tools

**Bookmarks**
- Searching bookmarks (`search-bookmarks`)
- Reading a bookmark (`get-bookmark`, `get-bookmark-content`)
- Listing the lists that contain a bookmark (`get-bookmark-lists`)
- Creating text and URL bookmarks (`create-bookmark`)
- Updating a bookmark (`update-bookmark`)
- Deleting a bookmark (`delete-bookmark`)

**Lists**
- Listing all lists (`get-lists`)
- Retrieving a single list (`get-list`)
- Creating a list (`create-list`)
- Updating a list (`update-list`) — name, icon, description, parentId, query, public; field constraints (length caps, smart-query validation) are inherited from the shared schema
- Deleting a list (`delete-list`) — child lists are NOT deleted with the parent; they become root-level lists
- Listing bookmarks in manual and smart lists (`get-list-bookmarks`)
- Adding and removing bookmarks from lists (`add-bookmark-to-list`, `remove-bookmark-from-list`)

**Tags**
- Listing tags with filters / pagination (`get-tags`)
- Retrieving a single tag with usage counts (`get-tag`)
- Renaming a tag (`update-tag`)
- Deleting a tag (`delete-tag`) — bookmarks that had the tag are not deleted
- Listing the bookmarks attached to a tag (`get-tag-bookmarks`)
- Attaching and detaching tags on bookmarks (`attach-tag-to-bookmark`, `detach-tag-from-bookmark`)

**Assets**
- Getting a temporary signed download URL for an asset (`get-asset`)

**Highlights**
- Listing highlights across all bookmarks (`list-highlights`)
- Listing highlights for a bookmark (`get-bookmark-highlights`)
- Retrieving a single highlight (`get-highlight`)
- Creating, updating, and deleting highlights (`create-highlight`, `update-highlight`, `delete-highlight`)

Currently, the MCP server only exposes tools (no resources).
